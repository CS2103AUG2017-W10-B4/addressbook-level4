=== Enhancement Added: Find a person via the contact tags

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=findtag]

#End of Extract#

==== Justification

The address book had tags for each contact, however there was no way to search for contact with certain tags.

=== Enhancement Added: Locate a person

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

May help the user finding the contact address quickly and perhaps direction if the user want to go there.

Similar to select command but load a google map page instead.

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=event]

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=reminder]

Overall behavior is similar to Person class logic and model.
