=== Enhancement Added: `phone`

==== External behavior
Locating persons by phone number.

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=phone]

Finds person whose phone numbers match with at least a phone number in the specified list
Format: `phone NUMBER [MORE_NUMBERS]`

****
* The order of phone numbers being queried does not matter.
* Only the phone number is searched.
* Only full numbers will be matched e.b. '12345' will not match '123456' // can be modifed latter to match a chain of partial number
****
